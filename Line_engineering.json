            "date": "07:20: 2017",
            "abstract": "\nBefore we begin\nHi everyone, I am Freddie Wang from LINE Fukuoka\u2019s development team. I\u2019m currently in charge of developing a new Android app called LINE Creators Studio. LINE Creators Studio is a sticker creation tool that lets anyone create his or her own stickers and sell them on LINE Store.\nIn this blog, I\u2019d like to talk about Kotlin, the programming language which the LINE Creators Studio app is built on. I will explain why we chose Kotlin as our main language and introduce some of the Kotlin features we are using.\nNote: LINE Creators Studio is currently available in Japan only. It will be released to other regions soon.\nAdvantages and key features of Kotlin\nWhy Kotlin?\nAt Google I/O 2017, Google announced that Kotlin is now officially supported in Android Studio 3.0. When we kicked off the development project for LINE Creators Studio at the end of 2016, we were tasked with the challenge of growing it into an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) project in a very short time. Although Kotlin 1.0 had been released quite some time ago, no one in our team had the experience of using Kotlin. We spent some time to conduct a survey on Kotlin before starting the development and eventually decided to use Kotlin because of the benefits it provides as described below.\n100% interoperable with Java\nThe most appealing aspect of Kotlin is that you can mix Kotlin code and Java code in the same project and continue to use all existing Java libraries. Although we don\u2019t have any legacy Java code in our project, we wanted to use some awesome libraries such as Dagger 2, Retrofit, and RxJava.\nConcise syntax\nKotlin is designed for solving problems. One of its main goals is to write clean code more easily than Java. This is the first and foremost essential factor for us when developing Android applications.\nReduced dependencies\nKotlin has a compact runtime library which can replace some large Java libraries such as Guava. Using large libraries may not be a problem in server or desktop environments but it can be problematic in Android. Because the Android environment puts 65K methods limit on Android apps, we should avoid using large Java libraries. Kotlin\u2019s stdlib library (version 1.1.3-2) has only 6306 methods, which means it has less impact than the Guava libraries in terms of the number of methods.\nCompatible with old Android devices\nKotlin 1.0 is based on Java 6, which means it can support Android devices whose version is 2.3 or higher. This is another very important factor for Android developers.\n#Android #Kotlin #Programming language\n",

            "abstract": "\nBefore we begin\nHello, we are Jongkyu Lim and Joonghoon Shin responsible for processing of ads data and development of ads platform in LINE. In this blog post, I\u2019d like to talk about BigDB: a big data processing pipeline for LINE ads. I\u2019ll go into detail about how BigDB came to be, what BigDB is, how it\u2019s structured, what it does, and what use cases it has.\nHow BigDB came to be\nAs we gather data from various services that are growing in size, the size of the data grows larger as well, making it difficult to properly use them for analysis. Up until now, we\u2019ve used several open solutions that support big data to tackle this problem. While using several of these open solutions that have different strengths and weaknesses, we felt the need for a more simple and standardized way to collect, process, and look up data. And that is where the idea for BigDB began. Below are some of the key features we had in mind for BigDB. \nIntroducing BigDB\nWhat is BigDB\nBigDB is a big data processing pipeline for LINE ads. It can collect, reprocess, and look up data. LINE ads are analyzed in two ways: The first is in real-time whenever an ad is shown to a user. The second is batch analysis, where events are collected and analyzed after a set time, such as hourly or daily. BigDB fluidly provides the data used for analysis. Sometimes combining time series and static data if necessary.  \n\n#Big-Database #Big-DB #Data-pipeline\n",

We believe that location-awareness will be a driving force in the advancement of mobile technology, and that\u2019s why we are building a beacon network by deploying LINE Beacon to as many places as possible. This is in line with two key factors of the online-to-offline (O2O) ecosystem: geo-linked applications using location-aware technology and platforms with a high user base.\nO2O messaging is used to connect the online digital platform to offline merchants. In terms of commerce, the aim of O2O is to drive customers from the online marketplace and platforms (where they spend most of their time) to offline brick-and-mortar stores. This can happen through digital coupons, membership cards, and proximity marketing. That\u2019s why we designed various beacon applications to build online-to-offline networks where the virtual world expands to the real world.\nO2O and beacons link everyday products and features such as LINE Coupon, LINE Points, and LINE Shop Card to drive sales. We can push GeoADs (geo-linked advertisements) to promote stores, clients, and events with LINE business accounts (such as official accounts or LINE@ accounts) to nearby LINE users. By encouraging LINE users to walk into stores using LBS (location-based service) incentives such as coupons and stickers, we can enhance the user experience and help LINE@ owners, who have an LBS add-on such as indoor navigation or a shopping guide, achieve higher user retention rates.\n\n#Beacon #Bot #o2o\n",

Implementing the new features was simpler than I expected, thanks to Elastic Stack. However, I did encounter some issues while the system was up and running and solving the problems was quite difficult. Now, we are about to upgrade Elastic Stack to version 5.x. I was in a need to learn from other users\u2019 experiences and to learn new features and the optimal ways to implement the new features. This is why I attended the conference.\nLet me start by showing you some pictures of the conference.\nThe first thing I did at the conference was getting an attendee card.

In this post I\u2019m going to talk about the LINE Security Bug Bounty Program and the results of the program in 2016. The LINE Security Bug Bounty Program is an ongoing program to make the LINE app more secure for our users by letting external engineers submit bug (vulnerability) reports which we would then immediately fix. \nWe first conducted a trial run of the program called the LINE Bug Bounty Program from August 24 to September 23 in 2015. Based on our experience from that trial, we made various changes to create an improved bug bounty program for 2016. And on June 2, 2016, we launched the new and improved LINE Security Bug Bounty Program.\nFor more information about the LINE Bug Bounty Program, see our previous blog posts: \u201cIntroducing the LINE Bug Bounty Program\u201d and \u201cResults From the LINE Bug Bounty\u201d \nLINE Security Bug Bounty Program website:  https://bugbounty.linecorp.com/\n\n#BugBounty #Security\n",

I will share what the event was about, and what Haskell is in this post. \n\nWhat is Haskell?\nHaskell is a modern application programming language that helps you write high-performance software with a great deal of flexibility, composability, and safety. With recent successful cases of adopting Haskell by companies like Facebook or Standard Chartered, this innovative tool has been gaining attention as it has inspired many libraries and concepts in other languages.\nLINE is not an exception in this regard. With growing interest in Haskell, there is an increasing number of developers having study group meetings on Haskell or developing internal services written in Haskell. The LINE Haskell Boot Camp was a five-day gathering of engineers attempting to enter the world of safer and happier programming. Instead of diving into the depths of Haskell\u2019s theoretical background, we chose to have a hands-on experience to effectively spur further enthusiasm for Haskell. The event was organized by Han, a LINE Plus Corporation engineer who recently released an internal web service in Haskell. \n#haskell\n",

In this post, I\u2019d like to explain the architecture behind the chatting function of LINE LIVE, a video streaming service.\nIntroduction\nLINE LIVE for iOS and Android has a chat feature that lets its users send comments in real-time while they are watching a live-streaming video. This not only lets users (or viewers in this case) communicate with each other, but it also lets the streamers connect with their viewers. Streamers can chat with their viewers back and forth, and sometimes plan their videos according to what the viewers say in the chat. This is why the chat is an integral part of the streaming experience.\nAs you can probably imagine, celebrity live streams attract a large number of viewers, and along with them a torrent of comments. Comments sent to the stream must be simultaneously broadcast to every other viewer, and effectively distributing the load has always been one of our top-priority tasks. There are sometimes 10,000 comments sent per minute on just one stream alone.\nWe took the possibility of large amounts of comments into consideration when we were developing LINE LIVE and presently have over 100 server instances in operation for the chat feature.\n#Architecture #LINE LIVE\n",

There are already many mobile and web apps out on the market that utilize the login features of the LINE Login Platform. In this article, we will take a closer look at Popcorn Buzz and LINE STORE to see exactly how they use this powerful platform.\nPopcorn Buzz: LINE Login Platform for Mobile Apps\nPopcorn Buzz is a free app for Android and iOS which provides a group calling service that lets users talk to up to 200 people at the same time. Developers usually use a screen like the one shown below when integrating the login feature into a mobile app like Popcorn Buzz. The login screen displays a \u201cLog in with LINE\u201d button that calls the login feature of the LINE Login Platform the moment the user taps it. If the user has the LINE app installed on their device, it automatically takes them to a second screen where they are asked to confirm that they want to log in with LINE. The login process is over before the user has a chance to blink. The superior login functionality offered by the LINE Login Platform leads to a better overall user experience on many apps the world over.  \n#LINE Login\n",
