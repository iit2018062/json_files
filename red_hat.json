The value that is stored first is expected to be read by the subsequent access. In many instances, aliasing is harmless: It is common, safe, and usually optimally efficient to use two pointers of the same type to read, and even to write to the same object.

In most cases, the connectors need to authenticate when connecting to the other systems, so you will need to provide credentials as part of the connector\u2019s configuration.
