It\u2019s the quality of never accepting \u201cstandard\u201d as okay and the guiding principle for creating new and remarkable things. One of the ways we foster that creative spirit at Yelp Engineering is through our internal hackathons. Many remarkable projects have come out of them - some of them open sourced, some of them revealing interesting demographic insights and some of them pushing the boundaries of science & technology. The 19th edition of our internal hackathon wasn\u2019t any different. Close to 80 fantastic projects across our engineering offices...",

It is a fantastically versatile datastore, and a great complement for our developers to our MySQL and Elasticsearch offerings. However, our infrastructure is not done until it ships and is monitored. When we started deploying Cassandra we immediately started looking for ways to properly monitor the datastore so that we could alert developers and operators of issues with their clusters before cluster issues became site issues. Distributed datastores like Cassandra are built to deal with failure, but our monitoring solution...",

One step in creating a service is to decide how many compute resources it needs. From the inception of PaaSTA, changing a service\u2019s resource allocation has required manually editing and pushing new configs, and service authors had to pore over graphs and alerts to determine the proper resource allocation for a service whenever load requirements changed. This changed earlier this month when autoscaling was introduced into PaaSTA. Why did we do this? Autoscaling was introduced into PaaSTA to make sure services are allocated...",
