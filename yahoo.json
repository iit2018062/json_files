Omid complements Apache HBase, a distributed key-value store in Apache Hadoop suite, with a capability to clip multiple operations into logically indivisible (atomic) units named transactions. This programming model has been extremely popular since the dawn of SQL databases, and has more recently become indispensable in the NoSQL world. For example, it is the centerpiece for dynamic content indexing of search and media products at Verizon, powering a web-scale content management platform since 2015.",

The database stores billions of records and handles millions of read and write requests per second at millisecond latencies. The data we have in this database must be persistent, and the working set is larger than what we can fit in memory. Therefore, a key component of the database performance is a fast storage engine. Our current solution had served us well, but it was primarily designed for a read-heavy workload and its write throughput started to be a bottleneck as write traffic increased.",

Modern decision support and machine intelligence engines strive to continuously ingest large volumes of data while providing up-to-date insights with minimum delay. For example, in Flurry Analytics, an Oath service which provides mobile developers with rich tools to explore user behavior in real time, it only takes seconds to reflect the events that happened on mobile devices in its numerous dashboards. The scalability demand is immense \u2013 as of late 2017, the Flurry SDK was installed on 2.6B devices and monitored 1M+ mobile apps. Mobile data hits the Flurry backend at a huge rate, updates statistics across hundreds of dimensions, and becomes queryable immediately. Flurry harnesses the open-source distributed interactive analytics engine named Druid to ingest data and serve queries at this massive rate.",

From single-sign-on and identity federation with SAML; to the newer identity protocols including OpenID Connect, OAuth2, JOSE, and SCIM (to name a few); to the explorations of \u201cself-sovereign identity\u201d based on distributed ledger technologies; standards have played a key role in providing a secure identity layer for the Internet.",
